# 💳 Credit Scoring Model

This project predicts an individual's **creditworthiness** based on historical financial data. It applies multiple **classification algorithms** such as **Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest** to classify credit scores as **Good** or **Bad**.

The goal is to evaluate model performance and select the best-performing model for reliable credit risk assessment.


## 📂 Dataset

**Dataset Source:**  
Kaggle – Credit Score Dataset  
🔗 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akritiupadhyayks/credit-score-dataset  

### Key Features:
- Income  
- Debt  
- Credit Limit  
- Payment History  
- Current Balance  
- Engineered Features:
  - Debt-to-Income Ratio  
  - Credit Utilization  


## ⚙️ Steps Followed

1. **Load and Explore Data**  
   - Checked dataset structure  
   - Identified missing values and duplicates  
   - Reviewed basic statistical summaries  

2. **Data Cleaning**
